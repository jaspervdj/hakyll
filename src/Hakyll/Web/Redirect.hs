-- | This function exposes a higher-level interface compared to using the
-- 'Redirect' type manually.
--
-- This creates, using a database mapping broken URLs to working ones, HTML
-- files which will do HTML META tag redirect pages (since, as a static site, we
-- can't use web-server-level 301 redirects, and using JS is gross).
--
-- This is useful for sending people using old URLs to renamed versions, dealing
-- with common typos etc, and will increase site traffic.  Such broken URLs can
-- be found by looking at server logs or by using Google Webmaster Tools.
-- Broken URLs must be valid Haskell strings, non-URL-escaped valid POSIX
-- filenames, and relative links, since they will be defined in a @hakyll.hs@
-- and during generation, written to disk with the filename corresponding to the
-- broken URLs.  (Target URLs can be absolute or relative, but should be
-- URL-escaped.) So broken incoming links like <http://www.gwern.net/foo/> which
-- should be <http://www.gwern.net/foobar> cannot be fixed (since you cannot
-- create a HTML file named @"foo/"@ on disk, as that would be a directory).
--
-- An example of a valid association list would be:
--
-- > brokenLinks =
-- >     [ ("projects.html", "http://github.com/gwern")
-- >     , ("/Black-market archive", "Black-market%20archives")
-- >     ]
--
-- In which case the functionality can then be used in `main` with a line like:
--
-- > version "redirects" $ createRedirects brokenLinks
--
-- The 'version' is recommended to separate these items from your other pages.
--
-- The on-disk files can then be uploaded with HTML mimetypes
-- (either explicitly by generating and uploading them separately, by
-- auto-detection of the filetype, or an upload tool defaulting to HTML
-- mimetype, such as calling @s3cmd@ with @--default-mime-type=text/html@) and
-- will redirect browsers and search engines going to the old/broken URLs.
