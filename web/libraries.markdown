# Libraries

Since some functionality is too specific to be included in the main Hakyll
library, people have generously written utility libraries and tools for Hakyll.
Here is a list of the ones I know of (I would be happy to hear about others).

- [hakyll-contrib-links](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll-contrib-links),
  a Hakyll library that helps maintain a separate links database.
- [hakyll-agda](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll-agda),
  a simple module useful to generate blog posts from literate Agda files.
- [hakyll-contrib-hyphenation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll-contrib-hyphenation),
  automatic hyphenation for Hakyll.
- [hakyll-convert](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll-convert),
  a conversion tool from other blog engines to Hakyll.
- [hakyll-elm](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll-elm),
  Hakyll wrapper for the Elm compiler.
